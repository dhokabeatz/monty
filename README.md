# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

![Monty](monty.jpg)

## Description

This project implements an interpreter for the Monty language, focusing on the concepts of stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out) and queues (FIFO - First In, First Out). The Monty language is a minimalistic, stack-based programming language that supports a set of operations for manipulating data on these data structures.

## Features

- Stacks and Queues: The interpreter supports the stack and queue data structures, allowing for operations like push, pop, swap, enqueue, and dequeue.

- Monty Language: Monty provides a simple syntax with a concise set of operations, making it easy to write and understand Monty programs.

- Error Handling: The interpreter includes robust error handling, providing informative error messages for common programming mistakes or invalid operations.

## Usage

To use the Monty interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dhokabeatz/monty.git`

2. Build the interpreter: `make`

3. Run Monty programs: `./monty <path_to_file.m>`

## Monty Language Examples

Here are a few examples of Monty programs:

1. Pushing numbers onto the stack and printing them:

2. Adding the top two elements of the stack:

3. Enqueuing and dequeuing elements from a queue:
